Commerce Group Members List Extractor

Commerce Group Members List Extractor is a simple application that allows an user to search through objects on the Novell Network Tree of the University of Cape Town (UCT) network via LDAP (Light-weight Directory Access Protocol) calls and extract lists from Novell Group objects, using a specified group filter.

Usage: Commerce Group Members List Extractor.exe GROUP_OBJECT 
where GROUP_OBJECT is the group (e.g. CF_ALLSTAFF_G) you wish to extract member names from. The * character acts like a wildcard character.
